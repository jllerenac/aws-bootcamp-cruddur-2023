# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

Installed docker extension in VS code and also created an account on docker hub.

Watched the videos: `how to ask for technical help`,`Grading homework summaries`, `live stream video` and the other videos mentioned in the checklist and the ones from the exam pro account play list. 

### Creating the Dockerfile 

In the folder `backend-flask` create the file `Dockerfile` which should have the following content 

The comments are optional but recommended 

```
# slim buster is an image from the docker hub
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# directory where we want to work
WORKDIR /backend-flask

# copies from outside of container to inside
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#first period outside the container and the second one is inside 
COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

# to expose the port outside the container
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]

```

Now lets install the requirements for our application with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then we run the server with `python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567`

The application to work needs to have the following env variables set up
```
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
```
Then we can run the application

Next step is to build the docker container with `docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask`

Then we have to run with the command `docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' backend-flask`
Notice that we need to specify the environment variables and the container image has to go at the last in order to get the env variables set up first. Another important thing is to use single quotes for the variable due to the shell interpretation of the double quotes.
